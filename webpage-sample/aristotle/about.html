		<br/><h3> Computational Argumentation Framework </h3> 
			  In artificial intelligence, traditionaly, a knowledge base is a set of
		<br/> rules representing the knowledge of an expert in a specific domain. In
		<br/> this context, there are no contradictions in the knowledge base and
		<br/> undefeasible conclusions can be derived from it by the modus ponens
		<br/> inference rule. In the context of argumentation, however, a knowledge
		<br/> base combines the knowledge of multiple experts, who can have
		<br/> divergent opinions about a same topic (i.e., the knowledge base can
		<br/> have imperfect informations). In this case, another reasoning schema,
		<br/> called modus non excipiens, must be used to derive defeasible
		<br/> conclusions.
		<br/>
		<br/> Argumentation is a general technique to reason in the presence of
		<br/> imperfect information, which involves the formulation of arguments
		<br/> concerning a specific claim. Because arguments are normally
		<br/> constructed from imperfect information, there are often
		<br/> counterarguments for them. Arguments and counterarguments are usually
		<br/> formulated from information, taken from a conflicting knowledge base,
		<br/> which can be incomplete, inconsistent, uncertain or subjective.
		<br/>
		<br/> A conflicting knowledge base is composed of strict rules (i.e., rules
		<br/> which have no exceptions) and defeasible rules (i.e., rules which have
		<br/> exceptions). A strict rule has the form conditions -> conclusion (if
		<br/> the conditions hold, then we necessarily have the conclusion),
		<br/> whereas a defeasible rule has the form conditions >- conclusion (if
		<br/> the conditions hold, then we possibly have the conclusion). In this
		<br/> rules, 'conditions' is a conjuntion of literals (or a single literal)
		<br/> and 'conclusion' is a single literal. A literal is an atom (e.g., p)
		<br/> or the strong negation of an atom (i.e., ~p). Unlike negation as
		<br/> failure (or weak negation), strong negation is not based on the Closed
		<br/> World Assumption (CWA). It worth noticing that (i) a strict rule with
		<br/> condition 'true' is a 'fact', whereas a defeasible rule with condition
		<br/> 'true' is a 'presumption'; (ii) rules with variables are, in fact,
		<br/> schemas for propositional rules). Rules are univocally numbered and,
		<br/> if a defeasible rule i is an exception to another defeasible rule j,
		<br/> then the declaration i>j must be included in the conflicting knowledge
		<br/> base. For example, consider the following rules:
